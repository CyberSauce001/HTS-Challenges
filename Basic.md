| Basic 1 | Inspect Elements - should give you the password                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Basic 2 | Inspect Source, Go to the Network Tab, refresh page and it should cache the password                                                                                                                                                            |
| Basic 3 | Inspecting the Elements, you be looking in the password submit box, there you can see it directs you to a password.php, type in the /password.php and it will redirect you to the password                                                      |
| Basic 4 | Inspect the Elements where it says send password, change the html attribute from hidden to show. Input your hackthissite email that you registered with. It will send you the password.                                                         |
| Basic 5 | Same as Basic 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Basic 6 | Testing aaaaaaaa, we will notice it shifts 1 over, for every next character.  <br>Using this site: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ASCII_full.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ASCII_full.svg)  <br>We find that 199439d2 = 1:;77>j9 |
| Basic 7 | With the given hint before entering, it ask you to know some basic unix such as whoami, cd, and so forth. Using this knowledge we are given a search bar. Go ahead and do <code>cd ../;</code> If you see a white page you are on the right track. Now add <code> ls</code> after the previous command you did. There you should see a the php you are looking for. Go to that directory and the password is revealed.|
| Basic 8 | For this challenge we need to learn a bit about SSI, coming accross a documentation we would be running <code><[!]-- #exec cmd="ls" --></code>. Testing it out we can see we are going somewhere with this. Modify it further <code> <[!]-- #exec cmd="ls ../" --> </code>, we can see a php that stands out, by copying that and pasting onto the url, since we are in tmp make sure to delete everything after '/8'. The php should reveal the flag. *Remove the [] from the SSI payload* |
| Basic 9 | Using the last method and the follow prompt giving you the path. The only thing you need to change is the payload. < further <code><[!]-- #exe cmd="ls /var/www/hackthissite.org/html/missions/basic/9 "</code> now go back to the Basic 8 webpage, and plug in the payload. Then you will grab the weird php, and the same thing paste in in the url after '/9' |
| Basic 10 | Given hint before you enter the webpage is javascript , however there is also another way without javascript. If you go to the cookie on the webpage you will notice that level10_authorized value is no, just change it to yes. Enter a random password and you got this. For the javascript way in the console or url bar type <code>javascript:alert(document.cookie="level10_authorized=yes");</code>, enter the random password and you complete the challenge.|
| Basic 11 |Enter this webpage, you are giving a song. I didn't know what it was so I look it up, if you are to refresh the page, the song changes. All the song listed are Elton John's song. So looking up on apache they use file directory. So traversing though the files starting with '/e' (I tried /elton and it gave me an error) and you end up in a blank page. At this point it took a while to figure out there are hidden pages and in order to access it you need to know what to type in the url. In this case it was <code>.htaccess</code>, given a file, traverse to the file. The answer may be different for you, but don't over look it. The answer is already given to you. Now how to submit the answer? Well going back to /basic/11 webpage. You probably figure out that typing index.php will allow you to submit your answer. Do so and you complete Basic Challenges. |
