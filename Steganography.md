|Mission 1| The task given you hints about 2 Null Bytes. Looing it up its hex of '00'. Saving the immages from the task. You can use any hex editor and open the image. You will find that, you probably have to search '00 00' based on the hint. However don't be fool by the '00 00' at the beginning. You eventually traverse through and find a set of hex value between a '00 00' and another set of it. Convert those hex into binary. You should get something like this <code>0011100001100110011011101101000011000010111001100110110</code>. Decoding the binary will get you something weird, aligning it as an 8 bit (byte), you notice there is a missing space at the ending. Playing around I plug in a 0 at the first 8 bit and the password was revealed. Result: <code>00111000001100110011011101101000011000010111001100110110</code> |
|Mission 2| Download the wav file you are given. We will be doing some steganalysis. Depending on the program or os you are using it may be different from this write-up. I am using Windows 11 on mine, and I went ahead and download a free wavepad program to anaylze the file. I went ahead an open the files, playing around with it I see nothing, so I try different tools to see if I can manipulate the sound waves. Click on various tools I came across TFFT -> Temporal Frequency Analysis. I can see some words on it, now playing around I was able to make a password out of it. Hint: On the right side you can increase the brightness and zoom in to help.|
|Mission 3| Quite easy one, download the image, and use steg online or my prefer favorite [Aperisolve.fr](https://aperisolve.fr/), you should see the password. |
|Mission 4 | Down the gif file. From here I would be looking at the header byte for gif. Check the header byte nothing seems out of the ordinary. Scroll through at the very bottom there are binary in the image. Decoding the binary, you will get the password.|
|Mission 5| Download the image. Then you will want to be on your linux. You will use hexdump for this <code>hd stego5.bmp * cut -f 2-20  -d ” ” * tr “\n” ” ” * sed ‘s/   / /g’ * sed ‘s/  / /g’ > hd </code> (replace * with the straight bar). Next open the file and remove 00003a2e at the end of the file. Looking around there are some pixels, with 3 hex bits representing RGB. They are a bit off: 3e 3f 3f 4e 4f 4f 42 43 42 3b 3b 0a -> 0  1  1  0  1  1  0  1  0  1  1  0. The password should be syn-ack-rst.|
|Mission 6| Download the file. Then open Aperisolve, and throw it in. Scrolling through down to Zsteg, you notice a very long string. It is encoded in base64, let's decode it. Upon decoding, you got the flag.|
|Mission 7| After downloading this file and throwing it into aperisolve. The strings show adobe photoshop. Open the image in a photo editor of your choice. Upon opening the image, you notice there are 3 layers, look through the layers and remove the others to reveal the password.|
