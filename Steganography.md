|Mission 1| The task given you hints about 2 Null Bytes. Looing it up its hex of '00'. Saving the immages from the task. You can use any hex editor and open the image. You will find that, you probably have to search '00 00' based on the hint. However don't be fool by the '00 00' at the beginning. You eventually traverse through and find a set of hex value between a '00 00' and another set of it. Convert those hex into binary. You should get something like this <code>0011100001100110011011101101000011000010111001100110110</code>. Decoding the binary will get you something weird, aligning it as an 8 bit (byte), you notice there is a missing space at the ending. Playing around I plug in a 0 at the first 8 bit and the password was revealed. Result: <code>00111000001100110011011101101000011000010111001100110110</code> |
