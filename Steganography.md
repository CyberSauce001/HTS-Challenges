|Mission 1| The task given you hints about 2 Null Bytes. Looing it up its hex of '00'. Saving the immages from the task. You can use any hex editor and open the image. You will find that, you probably have to search '00 00' based on the hint. However don't be fool by the '00 00' at the beginning. You eventually traverse through and find a set of hex value between a '00 00' and another set of it. Convert those hex into binary. You should get something like this <code>0011100001100110011011101101000011000010111001100110110</code>. Decoding the binary will get you something weird, aligning it as an 8 bit (byte), you notice there is a missing space at the ending. Playing around I plug in a 0 at the first 8 bit and the password was revealed. Result: <code>00111000001100110011011101101000011000010111001100110110</code> |
|Mission 2| Download the wav file you are given. We will be doing some steganalysis. Depending on the program or os you are using it may be different from this write-up. I am using Windows 11 on mine, and I went ahead and download a free wavepad program to anaylze the file. I went ahead an open the files, playing around with it I see nothing, so I try different tools to see if I can manipulate the sound waves. Click on various tools I came across TFFT -> Temporal Frequency Analysis. I can see some words on it, now playing around I was able to make a password out of it. Hint: On the right side you can increase the brightness and zoom in to help.|
